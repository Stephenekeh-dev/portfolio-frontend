  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
I'm a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with over 6 years of hands-on 
experience in designing, building, and deploying scalable and complex full-stack applications. I  bring deep expertise in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Python
 (Django, Django REST Framework), Java (Spring Boot), and modern database systems including PostgreSQL  and MySQL.

My development approach blends clean, maintainable code with an eye for 

user experience — ensuring that every project is not just functional, but also fast, responsive,
 and visually engaging. I’m also skilled in using tools like Docker and Git to streamline workflows 
 and improve collaboration.
